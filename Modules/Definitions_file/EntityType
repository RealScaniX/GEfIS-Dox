An entity type defines a list of properties that define a specific type of thing.
For instance you can have a type called "thing" which does not have much but a name and a description. Then you can have a "ball" for which you might want to define additional \
properties like its size and color. A corresponding definition would look like this:
[A thing is an entity     // entity is the base type, you cannot have anything that is not an entity
	attributes
		text description is "Just a thing."		// we define a text property "description" with some default, "name" is already part of the base type "entity"

A ball is a thing
	its description is "It jumps, it rolls, it is a ball!"	// now all entities of this type have a new default description
	attributes
		text color		// the color as text "pretty dark pink" could be value
		number size		// diameter in cm
]

!Attribute types
An attribute can be another entity type or a so called primitive: %text%, %list%, %map%, %number% and %bool%.
Depending on the type, the possible default values differ to match a valid value for the corresponding type.
