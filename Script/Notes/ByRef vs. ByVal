[[ByRef]] is the passing of a variable through its reference empowering the receiving code to directly modify the original while [[ByVal]] denotes the passing of a variable \
through a copy of its value.

!Example for ByRef
In Gefis all entities are passed by reference, so you can modify the passed entity in nested functions.

[Entity {ListHolder} is an {Entity}
	attributes
		list {stuff}

function {addHello}
	understand
		{addHello }\[{lh}\]
	do
		add {"Hello"} to {lh.stuff}

// Some code from any possible code block
now {lh} is a new {ListHolder}
addHello {lh}
add {"world"} to {lh.stuff}
say {"Now the listholder has }\[+{lh.stuff.#}\]{ items."}]

<b>Will output: </b>Now the listholder has 2 items.

!Example for ByVal
Primitive values like %lists%, %maps%, %texts% and %numbers% are passed as a copy and cannot be used to modify the original.
 
[now {lh} is a new {ListHolder}
now {lst} is {lh.stuff}
addHello {lst}
add {"world"} to {lst}
say {"Now the listholder has }\[+{lh.stuff.#}\]{ items."}
say {"Now the list has }\[+{lst.#}\]{ items."}]

<b>Will output: </b>Now the listholder has 0 items.
Now the list has 1 items.

As you can see the [[{lst]]} has only been modified by direct calls and not by the invoked function. Also the %list% in the [[{lh}]] entity hasn't been modified at all, \
because [[{lst}]] only holds a copy of the %list%.
