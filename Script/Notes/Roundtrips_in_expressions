Roundtrips to the client and back do not work inside of evaluations. A roundtrip is usually triggered by a %wait%, %flush% or mode change (%start mode%, %end mode% and %switch mode%).
An evaluation happens whenever an %expression% is resolved.

The following example wouldn't work as expected:
[say {"Please enter a number!}\[ask for number\]{\nYou entered: }\[+{user.input}\]]{"}

This will immediately output "Please enter a number!" <b>and</b> "You entered: " and will <b>afterwards</b> wait for a user input.

To achieve the desired effect, the expression needs to be divided into say and other statements:
[say {"Please enter a number!"}
ask for number
say {"You entered: }\[+{user.input}\]]{"}
