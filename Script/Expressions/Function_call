xxx<div style="border:2px solid red;padding:12px;">This information is outdated. You now can use function names directly in an expression.</div>

!Function calls as expressions
If you want to call a %function% inside of an expression you can do so by enclosing it in square brackets ([[\[]] and [[\]]]).
Let's say you have defined a function [[isalive]] like this:

[function {isalive}
	do
		return {player.health > 0}]

And you want to use it in an %if% statement:

[if {\[isalive\]}
	say {"Yeah, you are still alive!"}
else
	say {"Game over!"}]

To see how to use functions as a statement please see %Statements/function call% under "Statements"!
