[{"..."}
{"...\[SCRIPTLINE\]...\[SCRIPTLINE\]..."]}]

A string can be a simple chain of letters, but can also contain nested %function calls% in square brackets ([[\[]] or [[\]]]).
Let's have a look at a pretty common example, the nested [[one of]] script:

[say {"The weather is }\[one of\]{fine}\[or\]{rainy}\[or\]{windy}\[or\]{nightmarish}\[at random\]{."}]

In reality this constructs a script like this:

[say {"The weather is "}
one of
	say {"fine"}
or
	say {"rainy"}
or
	say {"windy"}
or
	say {"nightmarish"}
at random
say {"."}]
Note: Please ignore the fact that [[say]] would normally add a linefeed when the string ends with a punctuation mark. This does not happen here.

!Nested expressions
You can add expression values to the string by using %append% or just by string concatenation using the plus sign ([[+]]) like this:

[{"Hello, "} + {player.charactername} + {"."}]

!Special characters
<ul><li>[[{\n}]]
Adds a line break at this position.
</li><li>[[{\t}]]
Adds a tabulator at this position.
</li><li>[[{\"}]]
A quoted quotation mark. See below for an explanation!
</li><li>[[{\\[}]]
A quoted opening bracket for the rare case that really mean to say that.
</li><li>[[{\\]}]]
And the closing counterpart.
</ul>

!Special statements
The following statements only work inside of a string.
<ul><li>[[\[line break\]]]
The same as [[{\n}]].
</li><li>[[\[quotes\]]]
The same as [[{\"}]].
</li><li>[[\[bracket\]]]
The same as [[{\\[}]].
</li><li>[[\[close bracket\]]]
The same as [[{\\]}]].
</ul>

!Escaping the quotes
A quotation mark ([["]]) inside of a string has to be escaped like this:

[say {"The drowning Goblin said \"Whargarbl!\", but unfortunately for him you're not familiar with the Goblin language."}]

<b>Will output: </b>The drowning Goblin said <i>"Whargarbl!"</i>, but unfortunately for him you're not familiar with the Goblin language.

!HTML quoting
As the output is [[HTML]] you should escape the brackets ([[&lt;]] and [[&gt;]]) that normally are used to define [[HTML elements]]. \
It normally suffices to quote the opening bracket.
That said, you can still use [[HTML]] to style your output.
Note: Although you won't have a problem in most cases when not quoting them, it makes the output more [[HTML]] conform and reduces unwanted side effects.

[say {"To check if x is smaller than y you write: &lt;b>x \&lt; y&lt;/b>"}]

<b>Will output: </b>To check if x is smaller than y you write: <b>x &lt; y</b>
