xxxSome macros are defined to insert some HTML constructs that would otherwise mean more work to add.

!Bar
[\<htmlbar "{TITLE}" {VALUE}/{MAXIMUM}\>]


!Link
[\<link {LINK}>{CONTENTS}\</link\>]
Other than the link shortcut in the preprocessor you can use evaluatable values here:
[now {link} is {"open door"}
say {"You can \<link \[+link\]\>open the door\</link\> to see what's inside."}]
