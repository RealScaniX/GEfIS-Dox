xxxSome simple constructs are processed and replaced by a more complex %string% before the actual parsing takes place to speed the process up a bit. They can only be used in %strings% \
and exist to make writing some html parts easier and keep the code more readable.
Note: This happens before anything else, so you will not be able to use any expressions that need evaluation inside of one of those.

!Link
[\[link {LINK}\]{CONTENTS}\[/link\]
\[link {LINK1}|{LINK2}|{LINK3}\]{CONTENTS}\[/link\]]

!Image
[\[image {RESOURCENAME}\]
\[image "{IMAGEURL}"\]]

!No line break
[\[no line break\]]
If your %say% text is ending with a period ([[.]]), but you don't want a line break.

!A|an
[\[a|an\]]

!Geviertstrich
[\[-\]]
Inserts a "&#8212;".

!Backspace
[\[backspace\]]
This is rarely used. It lets you remove the last character that has been printed. You can simulate someone typing and removing characters again with this.
See the alternative ending of "One"! =P
 
!Quoted values
Instead of using the backslash to quote some values you can also use these phrases:
<ul><li>["\[line break\]"]
Is the same as [["\n"]]
</li><li>["\[bracket\]"]
Is the same as [["\\["]]
</li><li>["\[close bracket\]"]
Is the same as [["\\]"]]
</li></ul>
