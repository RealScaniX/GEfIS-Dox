[There is a {ValueSponge} called {Globals}
	its {MusicVolume} is {100}
	its {SoundVolume} is {100}]

The [[ValueSponge]] EntityType is a special type for an %Entity% that allows arbitrary attributes.

As I decided against having global variables I added this type to still be able to have a dynamic list of values which still does not collide with other variable or entity names.

You can resolve any attribute name on a [[ValueSponge]] whether it exists (value will be != [[null]]) or not (value will be [[null]]).

Setting an attribute to [[null]] will effectively remove it from the %entity%.

There also is no type safety on a [[ValueSponge]], so you can set an attribute to a number first and then to a text value afterwards without a problem (at least technically).
