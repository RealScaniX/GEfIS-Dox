[append {EXPRESSION}]
[+{EXPRESSION}]

If you are writing a function that builds a longer text you can use a series of [[append]] statements to pass the combined result as return value.
In contrast to %return% this statement does not stop following script lines from being executed.
Note: A %return% statement with an %expression% will only pass that value to the calling code. If there is an accumulated value from [[append]] statements, it is discarded.

[function {count2ten}
	do
		for {i} from {1} to {10}
			if {i > 1}
				append {", "}
			append {i}]

If this function is called it will return the %string% [[{"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"}]].

!String expressions
Another use of [[append]] is to add an expression value to a %string% expression:

[say {"Random numbers:\n}\[for {i} from {1} to {30}\]{Number }\[+i\]{ is: }\[append random number between {1} and {100}\]{\n}\[end\]"]

Both [[{i}]] and [[random number between {1} and {100}]] are expressions that are added to the string using append. The output will then look \
like this:

[Random numbers:
Number 1 is: 71
Number 2 is: 95
Number 3 is: 7
Number 4 is: 96
Number 5 is: 73
...]
Note: Your output might look a little different as the numbers are [[random]]. ;)
