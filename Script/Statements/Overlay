!Description
Overlays can be used to display additional text or images in an overlay over the text or other ui elements of the frontend.
You can switch between the old and new contents which will result in a transition on the client.

The [[{CONTENT}]] is any valid [[HTML]] content that can be displayed inline. You can use the %preprocessor% to shorten the text you \
have to write to display images and links.

The [[{NAME}]] has to be one of the existing three overlay names: [[NW]], [[NE]] and [[SE]]. The [[{NAME}]] of an overlay is an identifier and \
does not have to be enclosed in quotation marks (").

The [[{STYLE}]] can be one of the these:
<ul><li>a predefined value
[[{"default"}]]: resets the look to the one of the selected theme
[[{"frameless"}]]: removes all borders and backgrounds so only the given contents are visible
</li><li>an html color value
[[{"#RRGGBB"}]], [[{"blue"}]], [[{rgba(r,g,b,a)}]], ...
</li><li>a css style
any valid style attribute value, e.g. [[{"border:2px solid green;padding:10px;"}]]
</li></ul>

!Show
[show (({CONTENT} in)) overlay {NAME} ((with style {STYLE}))]

If the overlay is visible at the moment it will be faded out.
Then the content and style is changed. Afterwards the overlay is faded in (again).

!Set
[set (({CONTENT} in)) overlay {NAME} ((with style {STYLE}))]

Very similar to [[show]] but does not change the visibility of the overlay, only changes the [[{CONTENT}]] and [[{STYLE}]].

!Hide
[hide (({CONTENT} in)) overlay {NAME} ((with style {STYLE}))]

Hides the overlay with the name [[{NAME}]].
Note: Why does the [[hide]] statement has a [[{CONTENT}]] and [[{STYLE}]]? Those are applied after the overlay has been hidden and can be used to preload images etc. \
It really just is a convenience shortcut for having to write a [[hide]] and a [[set]] to achieve that effect.
