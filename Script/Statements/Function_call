xxx!Function calls in script
Let's say you want to define a function to say something dynamic:

[function {sayhealth}
	do
		say {"You are }\[if {player.health > 0}\]{fine}\[else\]{dead}\[end\]{."}]

You can then use this function in your code like this:

[say {"Your general status is:"}
sayhealth]

To see how to use functions as an expression please see %Expressions/function call% under "Expressions"!
